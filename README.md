## Events

### Base Ahoy Event Model

Ahoy Events are parsed in the `models/staging/cc/base/base_cc__ahoy_events` model. All staging models are derived from this base model.

### Events in Need of Documentation

The directory `analysis/events_in_need_of_documentation` constains event models that are almost ready to be included, but the contents and naming need to be confirmed and documentation needs to be written.
